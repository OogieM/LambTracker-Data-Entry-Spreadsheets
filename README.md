Blank Libre Office spreadsheets to collect initial data for entry via CSV imports into the LambTracker SQLite Database.

Use these to collect the initial data for various tables when starting a new flock into LambTracker or converting from an older system of flock management. 

User must be able to create and save .CSV files and use .CSV files to create input or update statements to the LambTracker SQLite database.

The files correspond to the table names in LambTracker and the columns are the field names in that table.
